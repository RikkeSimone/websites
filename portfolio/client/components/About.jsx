            <p>Welcome to not only my online portfolio, but also my wee online playground!</p><br></br>

             <p>My name is Rikke and I am a trained full stack developer. Web development has been an interest 
              of mine for years, which finally pushed me to transition into tech this year, 
              turning my web development hobby into a full time career. 
              </p><br></br>
            
            <p>Commended for being approachable and caring within a team environment, as well as being extremely 
              forward thinking and always developing new ideas, I aim towards providing web development solutions which 
              benefit my clients and colleagues alike.
            </p> <br></br>
            
            <p>I am always seeking new challenges and interesting web development projects to work on so feel free to contact me with any queries you might have. Whether if you're an employer seeking 
              a long term permanent developer or just in who is in dire need of a website, I am here to help.</p>
